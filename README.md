# Linear-regression-ML

This is the code for "How to Make a Prediction - Intro to Deep Learning #1' by Siraj Raval on YouTube

- <b>Overview:</b>
This is the code for this video by Siraj Raval on Youtube. This is the 1st episode in my 'Intro to Deep Learning' series. 
The goal is to predict an animal's body weight given it's brain weight. The model we'll be using is called Linear Regression. 
The dataset we're using to train our model is a list of brain weight and body weight measurements from a bunch of animals. 
We'll fit our line to the data using the scikit learn machine learning library, then plot our graph using matplotlib.

- <b>Dependencies</b>

    pandas
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib

- <b>Usage</b>

Type python AnimalWtFromBrain_ml.py into terminal and you'll see the scatter plot and line of best fit appear.


- <b>Credits</b>

The credits for the original code go to gcrowder and Siraj Raval. I've merely watched the video and coded it.
